  <p>The time-series graph shows a consistent increase in CO₂ concentrations (measured in ppm) over the years, which indicates the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Simultaneously, a slight upward trend in global temperature change suggests that rising CO₂ levels are associated with global warming.</p>
