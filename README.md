## Introduction
This project analyses the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures, exploring historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating future scenarios based on CO₂ concentrations and temperature anomalies. By leveraging Python for data processing and visualization, we aim to gain insights into climate change patterns.                                                
## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
#To analyze the relationship between CO₂ emissions and global temperature anomalies.
#To identify historical trends and anomalies in temperature changes.
#To simulate potential future climate scenarios based on emission levels.
                                                                                                                                                                                         ## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project consists of:
Temperature Data: Annual temperature anomalies (°C) over the decades.
CO₂ Data: Monthly global atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (ppm).                                                                                                                              
## Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data analysis.
Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for executing the Python notebook.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualisation.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for predictive analysis.                                                                                                                              
## Methodology
   
# Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
Standardized data formats for consistency.

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Computed key statistics (mean, median, variance) for temperature changes and CO₂ levels.
Trend analysis of temperature anomalies over time.
Correlation analysis between CO₂ concentrations and temperature changes.

# Step 3: Data Visualization

Line charts showing temperature anomalies over decades.
Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies.
Histogram distributions of temperature changes.

# Step 4: Predictive Modeling

Developed regression models to predict future temperature anomalies based on CO₂ levels.

## Key Findings
   
Increasing Trend: Global temperature anomalies have increased over time, closely following the rise in CO₂ levels.
Strong Correlation: A significant correlation exists between atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and temperature rise.
Predictive Insights: Regression models suggest that without intervention, temperature anomalies will continue to rise, impacting global climate patterns.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the strong impact of carbon emissions on climate change. The findings can be used to inform climate policies and encourage the adoption of emission-reduction strategies. Future work could enhance the analysis by incorporating additional environmental factors, such as methane emissions and deforestation rates.

## Future Enhancements

Machine Learning Models: Implement deep learning approaches for more accurate predictions.
Real-Time Data Integration: Use APIs to fetch live CO₂ emission and temperature data.
Climate Policy Impact Assessment: Analyze the effectiveness of international agreements on reducing emissions.
